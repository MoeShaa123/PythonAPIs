# APIs
## API stands for application programming interface.
##  API acts as a communication layer, or as the name says, an interface, that allows different systems to talk to each other without having to understand exactly what each other does.
## A REST API (also known as RESTful API) is an application programming interface that conforms to the constraints of REST architecture.

## A call is made from a client to a server, and data is received back over the HTTP protocol.

## HTTP methods are an integral part of a RESTful API request.
